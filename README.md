# Stern-Gerlach Experiment Q circuit implementation  
  
Stern-Gerlach experiment is the traditional “rite of passage” experiment to study, in order to really
understand the difference between the two.  
a) Implement a simulator in Python for Stern-Gerlach experiment treating the system as a
randomly distributed tiny magnets governed by classical physics dynamics. (Classical physics
expectation from Stern-Gerlach experiment). Plot and comment on the results, and compare it
with the experimental outcome.  
b) Implement a simulator in Python for Stern-Gerlach using quantum spin. Plot and comment on
the results.  
Bonus: What happens when you have noise? Re-run the quantum spin either in a noise simulator, or
actual qubit.
